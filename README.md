# Bank Marketing Campaign

This is a study on the marketing campaign of a Bank. 
I have used machine learning algorithms and an uplift model to predict which clients could be persuaded to buy a new credit card.

- In [Inspection.ipynb](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/Inspection.ipynb) I have performed a first inspection of the dataset and feature engineering.
- In [Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb) I have analysed the dataset and trained the models.
- The models generated by my analysis are [control.model](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/control.model), [treatment.model](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/treatment.model), and [uplifting.model](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/uplifting.model).
