# Bank Marketing Campaign

This is a study on the marketing campaign of a Bank. 
I have used machine learning algorithms and an uplift model to predict which clients could be persuaded to buy a new credit card.

In [inspection.ipynb](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/LSpina_Part1_Inspection.ipynb) I have performed a first inspection of the dataset and feature engineering.
In [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/spinastro/Bank_Marketing_Campaign/blob/master/LSpina_Part2_Analysis.ipynb) I have analysed the dataset and trained the models.
